## Quicktex

To get quicktex to work with Quarto `*.qmd` files, we need to add  

`quarto.vim`  

in  

`~/.local/share/nvim/plugged/quicktex/ftplugin/`  

alongside the addition of `|| a:ft == quarto` in the *if statement* in line 18 in   

`~/.local/share/nvim/plugged/quicktex/autoload/quicktex/expand.vim`
